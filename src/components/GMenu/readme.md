##Todo
- transition
- CSS
- content positioning
    - nudge top/bottom/left/right
    - auto (center)
- open on hover
- close/open delay

##Done
- [x] align t/b/l/r
- [x] offset-X/Y
- [x] activator slot
- [x] attach content to root (solve page overflow)
- [x] click outside to close
- [x] lazy loading (defer logic until toggle)

##Roadmap
- attach to DOM (query selector)

##To be considered
- return-value (for g-select)
